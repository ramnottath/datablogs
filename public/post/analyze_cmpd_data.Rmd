# Analyzing CMPD Traffic Stops

In this post, we'll examine a data set of stops by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD). 

Our focus will be to understand what factors are related to whether someone is searched or not for a traffic stop.

```{r load-packages-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(ggspatial)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)
library(sf)
library(viridis)
library(ggridges)
library(gapminder)
library(forcats)
library(plotly)
df <- read_csv("Officer_Traffic_Stops.csv")
head (df)
```
